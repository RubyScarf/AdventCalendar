# AdventCalendar
A simple html file for a virtual advent calendar. It can be filled with optional content (text or links as it was planned to be a solo html file).
The goal is that it can be used from a local computer, no server needed, that is why the 'already seen' data is stored 
in the local storage and not in cookies.
